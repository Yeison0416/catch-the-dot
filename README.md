# 🎯 Catch The Dot
Catch The Dot is a small game built with JavaScript, RxJS, and Handlebars where you try to keep a countdown timer alive by hovering over a moving dot. The game speeds up as you play and challenges your reflexes while demonstrating reactive programming in action.
 
# 🚀 How to Play
1. Hover your mouse over the dot (ball).

2. Each hover:

* Increases your score.

* Resets the countdown timer (starts from 5).

* Changes the dot’s color (every 3rd hover).

* Shrinks the dot’s size temporarily.

3. Every multiple of 3:

* The game interval decreases (the timer runs faster).

4. If the countdown reaches 0, the game ends.

# 🛠 Tech Stack
* JavaScript (ES Modules)

* RxJS – reactive streams (fromEvent, scan, switchMap, tap, takeWhile)

* Handlebars – templating

* SCSS + reset-css – styling

* Webpack – bundling
